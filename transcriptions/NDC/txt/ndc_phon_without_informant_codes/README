Explanation of filenames

Owing to the fact that the corpus comprises material from several project, the filenaming conventions differ.

The majority of the filenames follow a simple convention. The filesnames comprise three parts: location, speaker 1, speaker 2, etc, in the following format - location_speaker1-speaker2

The speaker parts are either two digits followed by two letters (identifying an informant), or a series of letters (identifying an interviewer). Interviewers are always listed last. In the case of the former, the digits are simply a unique identifier and the letters refer to age and gender: g = old (gammel), u = young (ung), m = male (mann), k = female (kvinne).

Example: jevnaker_01um-02uk is a conversation between a young man and a young woman, from Jevnaker, while hof_04gk-sb is an interview with an older woman from Hof.

Material donated from other projects in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden, follows conventions according to those project.
